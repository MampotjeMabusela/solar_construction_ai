## Scripts

This folder is intended for data import/export and maintenance scripts, such as:

- Importing historical material usage from CSV/Excel.
- Importing past support transcripts and emails.
- Backfilling analytics tables (forecast performance, solar yield error, chatbot feedback).

You can implement these as small Node.js or Python scripts depending on your data sources.
