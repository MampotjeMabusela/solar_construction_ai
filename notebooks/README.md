## Notebooks

Use this folder for exploratory Jupyter notebooks, for example:

- Comparing different forecasting models and measuring MAPE.
- Calibrating pvlib simulations against local irradiance / production data.
- Prototyping RAG flows (chunking, embeddings, retrieval strategies) before moving code into the backend.

You can open notebooks directly in Cursor or any Jupyter-compatible environment.
